LabNotebook is a simple Excel-based database to keep your samples organized

## How to use it?

You'll need to have MS Excel installed, download and open the file, allow the macro to work (it opens the form to add, view, edit samples).

There are no additional files needed. You can save it in a shared folder (maybe Dropbox) and use it with your colleagues.
